# fixed_format

This code will process any .WP1 file in the /Data/ Directory to a fixed width and right justification of all cells. 
Additionally, it will add a blank row at row 13 and two blank rows at the top. 
The first row and first column contain the numeric file name.
It then outputs the formatted data as an .WP1 file into the /Output/ Directory.
